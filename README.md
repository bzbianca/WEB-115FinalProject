Throughout the project, I came across problems such as making sure everything works while being able to read each and every object in the task list. Features such as preventing invalid input since the prompt isnt coming up, and knowing how to do certain actions such as strikethrough and deleting tasks. But what really got me was the deleting of the tasks console list, since I did not account for this, I had made my code harder to follow and create this function in the code. I would have reviewed some functions that I have forgotten as I would think they would use during this project especially when we can't use the internet.
